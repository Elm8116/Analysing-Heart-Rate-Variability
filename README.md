Heart Rate Variability Analysis
===============================

Heart rate variability is evaluated by a number of methods which are
categorized as time-domain, spectral or frequency domain, geometric, and
nonlinear methods. This study concentrates on time-domain measurements,
which are used in most research studies of HRV analysis. The time-domain
measures the change in normal R wave to normal R wave (NN) intervals
over time and states the activity of circulation system.

Statistical HRV Features 
------------------------

Seven commonly used statistical time-domain parameters which are
calculated from HRV segmentation during 5-minute recording windows
comprised of RMSSD, SDNN, SDANN, SDANNi, SDSD, PNN50, and
AutoCorrelation, are considered in this study. Each of these HRV
assessment techniques is described in the following table.

  Parameter        Unit        Description
  ----------------- ---------- ------------------------------------------------------
  RMSSD             ms         The root-mean-square of successive differences
  SDNN              ms         The standard deviation
  SDANN             ms         The standard deviation of mean values of intervals
  SDANNi            ms         The mean standard deviation of intervals
  SDSD              ms         The standard deviation of differences
  PNN50             %          The percentage of differences greater than 50 (ms)
  AutoCorrelation              The correlation of successive intervals, called lags
